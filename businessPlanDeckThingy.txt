BUSINESS MODEL

[BRECK TODO]

RISK FACTORS
============

Lack of a well defined business model.

Bus factor risks.

Our habit of telling everyone, especially our competitors, exactly what we are going to do.

Encouraging more people to compete against us. Even helping them with their code.

Not owning any property except for some domains.

Not even owning our shortest domain  (PLDB.io), but instead leasing it from Venture.com.

Not having read the lease agreement in the above lease.

Not having read any multipage legal agreement we have been a party to.

Not believing in interviews.

Not having any employees nor have any plans to have employees.

No benefits plan.

No actual office just a coworking space.

Prioritizing talking to customers over everything else.

Lack of investment in any type of cyber security.

Not providing work email addresses to team members.

A lack of any team onboarding process.

Not having NDAs.

Nor IP assignment agreements.

Not believing in the concept of IP at all (Imaginary Property).

Frequent outburts directed at billionaires, government leaders, military leaders, and interns who accidentally sent us a spam message one time.

Not valuing our investors.

No plans to off shore revenues or engage in any complicated tax reduction strategies.

Explicitly telling our investors that they should mark their investments zero.

Horribly inappropirate jokes about the msot offensive topics.

Not knowing the real names, ages, genders, ethnicities, locations, or even countries of our team members.

No loyalty to our team and ready to let anyone go at any time.

But not even letting people go since we don't have any agreements just telling them we will no longer pay them.

Propensity of our founder to focus on adding, not reducing, new risk factors.
