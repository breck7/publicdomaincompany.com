Angel Round
===========

We make The Scroll, a non-toxic, intelligent, trustworthy successor to The Web that works offline.
 https://wws.scroll.pub/ The Scroll

For consumers, The Scroll provides all the benefits of the Web but an order of magnitude better and faster.

For businesses, The Scroll eliminates unneeded complexity and streamlines their customer service, operations and marketing.

The Scroll is made possible by breakthroughs in computer science and mathematics that we invented including the PPS stack (Particles, Parsers, and Scroll) and the equations $E=T/A!$, $I=C/S$ and $P = {T^{C^R}}^I$.

Via The Scroll, we will make a world where every child, no matter where they are born, will get their own copy of humanity's most intelligent information.

Our customers buy "root names" on The Scroll, the same as they buy domain names for the web. We charge $100 for a 10 year root folder registration. Viewership to our products is in the thousands a day, and increasing at approximately 10% week over week.

We are deeply committed to our mission of liberating information, by not only building the world's best information products, but also by lobbying for legal changes to end copyrights and patents worldwide. We value craftsmanship, truth, courage, laughter, intelligence, science and love.

Our founder is Breck Yunits (Our World in Data, University of Hawai'i Cancer Center, Microsoft, Mozilla, YCombinator, HP, Visa, PayPal, Duke, Boston College HS, Brockton public schools; angel investor in over 70 startups). Breck owns ~95% & the remaining ~5% is held by early advisors and essential teammates.

We are raising $50,000 at a $934,000 pre-money ($984,000 post money) valuation.

As someone with 20 years of experience in the software and angel investing world, I am confident that this has the potential to be one of the greatest angel investments of all time and I am excited to share this opportunity with you. 

Great things happen to people that back me.

Thank you for believing in me, and together let's build a new world.

-Breck

Why is this better than the current web?
========================================

- Works offline. No matter what happens in geopolitics or with AGI, you have your own copy of humanity's best information.
- 10x faster. Files served from disk, not from online.
- More intelligent. A new language from the ground up that replaces HTML with semantics built in.
- 10x easier to build. 10x fewer works to right than other web languages.
- Non-toxic. No ads, no copyright. Remix anything.

What is GTM?
============
We already have a few smash hits (like PLDB) on the World Wide Scroll that get thousands of visitors a week, are very popular with influencers, and are growing at a healthy week over week rate.
In addition, we are putting an enormous effort into one on one sales to bring great builders to The Scroll.
