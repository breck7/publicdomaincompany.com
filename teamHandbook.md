The Public Domain Publishing Company

# Team Handbook

## Working with us

### What roles are available?

An updated list of roles along with how to apply is listed
on our jobs page:
https://publicdomaincompany.com/.

### Why did you ignore my application?

If you applied, we almost certainly reviewed your
application. If you didn't hear back, that's because we
think you're not good enough yet or it would cost us too
much to hire you. We need to move slow with our funds and
are trying to hire the world's most talented builders that
also are bad at calculating their true market value. If we
didn't hire you, it might not be because we think you're
bad, but because we think we won't be able to lowball you
with a terrible salary.

### Can you hire people outside the USA?

Not yet. But we're working on it. You can still apply even
if outside the USA.

### What is the pay range for team members?

Our pay scale translates too be approximately $15 per
hour up to $150 per hour. Almost everyone will make $15 per
hour or close to that in wages. The majority of compensation
will be in equity options, which you should expect to be
worth zero when the company goes bankrupt.

### How does vesting work?

Instead of a 12 month cliff, we have a 10 day cliff. If
you or us don't think this is a good fit after 10 days, you
can leave. Sometimes the fit is off or simply the timing is
off. No big deal. Leave and move on.

After day 10, vesting starts and happens continuously every
hour. Vesting periods are 10 years.

## What benefits do we provide?

Currently none. (Note: if you are the world's best
HR/Benefits person, apply to join!)

## How do I get paid?

Via PayPal, Coinbase, or traditional banking, every Friday
afternoon.

## Contracting for Us

### Why should I contract for Public Domain Company?

First, because we won't waste your time. Second, because you
will work on important problems. Third, because we will push
you to do your best work. Fourth, because everything you
build will be public domain, and after you leave us, you can
take it all with you. Fifth, because you will be
contributing to an important mission. Sixth, because we will
pay you (as little as we can get away with, but something
at least). Seventh, because if you are interested in some
day being a team member with shares, you'll need to have
built something with us before. Eight, because if we
can figure out how, we'll offer benefits to those who
contract for us. Nine, because the idea of "employees" is
perhaps stupid, and contracting is perhaps the better long
term solution in general.

### How much notice do I have to give when I quit?

The longer notice you give the better, but if you just won
the lottery during your lunch break and want to come back
and tell us to go fuck ourselves that's fine to. Just send a
PR.

### Can I continue to use everything I worked on when I leave, including this handbook?

Of course you fucking can. That's the whole point of the
public domain.
