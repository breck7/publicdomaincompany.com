While some thought the 500 year old newspaper industry was on its last legs, the revolutionary software from Public Domain Publishing will ensure it has at least another 500 years ahead of it. Public Domain Publishing invented the most important fundamental technology in decades, which is already revolutionizing the fields of computer science and cancer research. Building on that technology, the company developed Scroll, a breakthrough new language that leaves all previous technologies used by newspapers in the dust.
