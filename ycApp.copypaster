did you pivot and what did you learn from the last idea?

in an incubator, "accelerator" or "pre-accelerator" program,

Why did you pick this idea to work on? Do you have domain
expertise in this area? How do you know people need what
you're making?

  Early Napster users. 🎧

What's new about what you're making? What substitutes do
people resort to because it doesn't exist yet (or they don't
know about it)?

  We are the first media startup to just say "fuck it let's
  publish everything to the public domain." 🚀🚀🚀

Who are your competitors, and who might become competitors?
Who do you fear most?

  Big media and big tech. We fear anyone who also switches
  to a 100% public domain model. If that happens we will go
  out of business 💥, but will have succeeded in our mission.

What do you understand about your business that other
companies in it just don't get?

  That public domain is the right way to treat ideas and
  treat people. Do what's right and the rest will take care
  of itself. This is the way. 🗽


How do or will you make money? How much could you make?
  
  Ticket sales, classifieds, and pay for feature

How will you get users?

  Filter the most 🤩 users amongst our current
  users, build what they want, and grow from there.
