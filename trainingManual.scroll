Everyone here is great at a least one thingâ€”that's why you are here. You are expected to excel at that one thing, but also to continue to grow your own abilities so you can help the team with more tasks as needed. You are also expected to always be thinking of how you can make yourself dispensable - by mentoring, recruiting, automating, et cetera. Your job in addition to shipping your tasks is to make sure we can succeed in our mission without you.
